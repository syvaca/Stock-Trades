# Stock-Trades

This is a program that uses a JSON file that holds information regarding public companies and their stocks, as well as a schedule of trades that is requested to be performed, to mimic trades that occur in a stock market.

I incoroprate the use of locks, semaphores, and multi-threaded programming into my code to allow for trades to occur simultaneously.
