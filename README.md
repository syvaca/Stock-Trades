# StockTrades

Create a program that mimic trades that occur in a stock market using a trade schedule and budget. I am able to parse a JSON file containing a set of companies information and a csv file that holds the schedule of trades requested to be performed. After ensuring accurate parsing of both files and querying the user for the total budget our stock brokers have in order to complete the trades, the sequence of trades made are outputted to the console.

I incoroprate the use of locks, semaphores, and multi-threaded programming into my code to allow for trades to occur simultaneously.
Other sub-topics that are covered include Java classes, File I/O, Sorting, JSON Parsing, and CSV Parsing.

All information in the input files can be determined/changed by the user, just make sure it stays in the same directory!
